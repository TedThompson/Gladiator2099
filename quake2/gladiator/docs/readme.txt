Unofficial v0.96 to v0.99u Patch for Quake 2 Gladiator Bot
---------------
This patch adds several features and improvements to the gameplay of MrElusive's Gladiator Bot for Quake 2, including a "Singleplayer Deathmatch" campaign.  After installation (see below) this campaign can be accessed either by:

1) selecting a skill level from Quake 2's main menu or by
2) using the console to set your skill level (ie: "skill 3") and then executing the "newgame" command.

Each of the 4 skill levels consists of 3 maps played against pre-determined bot characters, for a total of 12 levels.  The maps and bots used are fully customizable by editing the *.cfg files in the "sp_dm" folder included in this archive.

Compatibility
---------------
If you are already running Gladiator v0.96 on your system, then these updated game libraries should also work for you.  If not, pull-requests with fixes are welcomed at the GitHub address above.

Installation
---------------
Make a backup of the "gladiator" folder in your Q2 directory, then extract this archive to the "gladiator" folder in your Q2 directory, overwriting any existing files.  If there were already files named "autoexec.cfg" or "pak8.pak" in that location, they will need to be added back in using different names.

NOTE: When running Q2 as a dedicated server, "autoexec.cfg" must be executed manually.
