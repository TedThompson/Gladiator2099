Description             : A dismal, dank holding tank situated somewhere in the asteroid
                          belt.  Very symmetrical layout with a not-so-large multi-tier center 
                          hub; all weapons present EXCEPT the cheater's choice BFG.  This
                          level is best suited for >4 players.  GL multi-colored lighting is in,
                          (since I have a Voodoo!) but is used in a subtle manner - I felt 
                          garish red and blue tones would have ruined the "atmosphere" of the
                          map.
                          
Installation		: Place the tank21.bsp file into c:\quake2\baseq2\maps.
			        Run quake2 with: quake2 +map tww2dm

Additional Credits to   : Team Phoenix for "being there", ID software, Yahn Bernier for his
                          fantastic BSP, and also the buds I LAN-match with on the weekends, Ryan,
                          Baron, Joe, Newton, brother Kevin, et al for testing this sucker out.
